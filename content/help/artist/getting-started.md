## What is AMPLIFY?

AMPLIFY is a program by Music Declares Emergency that helps artists direct fans toward climate action. Your AMPLIFY link connects fans to vetted, grassroots climate organizations based on where they are.

**One link. Any country. Always works.**

---

## Your Dashboard

Your dashboard is your central hub for managing your AMPLIFY link. Here you can:

- View and copy your unique AMPLIFY link
- Generate QR codes for on-stage screens and printed materials
- Create and manage tours
- See how your link is doing

## Your AMPLIFY Link

Your unique link looks like this:

```
amplify.musicdeclares.net/a/your-handle
```

This single URL:
- Works anywhere in the world
- Automatically detects the fan's country
- Directs them to a relevant local climate org
- Never breaks, even between tours

### Where to Use It

- **Stage visuals**: Display the QR code during shows
- **Merch & posters**: Print the QR code—it's permanent
- **Newsletters**: Include in fan communications
