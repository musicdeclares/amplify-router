## Understanding Fallback Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** page shows you when fans couldn't be routed to an organization. This helps you understand and fix routing issues.

### Issues You Can Fix

- **No active tour**: Add a tour covering the relevant dates
- **Country not configured**: Add the country to your tour

### Issues Requiring MDE Assistance

Some issues require help from Music Declares Emergency:
- Organization temporarily paused
- No organization available for a country
- Organization website missing

For these, use the copy button next to the event to capture details, then share with your MDE contact.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens when my tour ends?

Your link still works. Fans see a general AMPLIFY page explaining the program and how to find climate organizations in their area.

### Can I have multiple tours?

Yes! You can create multiple tours, but only one can be active at a time (dates cannot overlap).

### What if there's no organization for a country?

Fans in countries without a partner org see the general AMPLIFY page. MDE is always adding new partners.

### Can I see how many people used my link?

Yes! Your dashboard shows routing statistics including total routes, successful routes to organizations, and fallback rates.

### What if an organization asks to pause?

MDE monitors this. If an org needs to pause (capacity issues, etc.), fans are automatically redirected elsewhere. You don't need to do anything.

### Is fan data collected?

No personal data is stored. The system only uses the fan's country (detected from IP) to route them. No tracking, no cookies, no personal information.

### Can I change my handle?

Handles cannot be changed after account creation because your AMPLIFY link may be printed on materials. If you need a change, contact your MDE representative.
