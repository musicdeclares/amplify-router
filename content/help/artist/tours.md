## Overview

Tours define when your AMPLIFY link actively routes fans to climate organizations. Outside of tour dates, fans see a general AMPLIFY information page.

---

## Creating a Tour

1. Go to **Tours** in the navigation
2. Click **Add Tour**
3. Enter:
   - Tour name (e.g., "European Tour 2026")
   - Start and end dates
   - Optional pre-tour and post-tour windows
4. Click **Add Tour**

---

## Tour Windows

- **Pre-tour window**: Activate routing days before the tour starts
- **Post-tour window**: Keep routing active days after the tour ends

This helps catch earlier clicks and lingering traffic.

---

## Configuring Country Routing

For each tour, you can specify which countries you're visiting:

1. Edit your tour
2. Click **Add Country** under "Fan Routing by Country"
3. Select each country where you'll perform

By default, fans are routed to MDE's recommended organization for each country. You can optionally select a specific organization if you prefer.

---

## How Routing Works

When a fan clicks your AMPLIFY link:

1. The system detects their country
2. Checks if you have an active tour
3. Redirects them to the org you specified or to MDE's recommendation
4. Falls back to a general AMPLIFY page if country, tour, or org checks fail

---

## Multiple Tours

You can create multiple tours, but only one can be active at a time (dates cannot overlap). This is by design: fans should always be routed based on your current tour context.

---

## Deactivating a Tour

If you need to temporarily stop routing without deleting the tour:

1. Edit the tour
2. Set the status to **Inactive**
3. Save changes

Fans will see the fallback page until you reactivate the tour.
