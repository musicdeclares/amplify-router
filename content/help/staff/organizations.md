## Overview

Organizations are the climate action groups that fans are routed to. The **Organizations** page lets you set MDE recommendations per country and manage org status.

---

## Setting MDE Recommendations

1. Go to **Organizations**
2. Click on a country
3. Set the recommended org for that country
4. Optionally set date-specific recommendations (e.g., election season)

---

## Pausing an Organization

If an org needs to be temporarily removed from routing:

1. Go to **Organizations**
2. Find the org
3. Toggle **Active** to off
4. Add a reason (optional but helpful)

Fans will be routed to the fallback instead.

## Understanding Analytics

The dashboard shows key metrics about routing activity.

### Key Metrics

- **Total Routes**: Successful redirects to org websites
- **Unique Artists**: Artists with active routing
- **Countries Reached**: Geographic distribution
- **Fallback Rate**: Percentage of visits that couldn't be routed

### Fallback Events

The **Recent Fallback Events** section shows when routing failed and why. Common reasons:

**`artist_not_found`** — Invalid artist handle
→ Check the link is correct

**`no_active_tour`** — No current tour for artist
→ Create or activate a tour

**`org_not_specified`** — No org for fan's country
→ Add country routing or MDE default

**`org_paused`** — Org is temporarily inactive
→ Resume or set alternative

**`org_no_website`** — Org has no website URL
→ Add website in org settings
