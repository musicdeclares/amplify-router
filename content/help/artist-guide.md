## What is AMPLIFY?

AMPLIFY is a program by Music Declares Emergency that helps artists direct fans toward climate action. Your AMPLIFY link connects fans to vetted, grassroots climate organizations based on where they are.

**One link. Any country. Always works.**

---

## Your AMPLIFY Link

Your unique link looks like this:

```
amplify.musicdeclares.net/a/your-handle
```

This single URL:
- Works anywhere in the world
- Automatically detects the fan's country
- Directs them to a relevant local climate org
- Never breaks, even between tours

### Where to Use It

- **Social bios**: Instagram, TikTok, Linktree, etc.
- **Stage visuals**: Display the QR code during shows
- **Merch & posters**: Print the QR code—it's permanent
- **Newsletters**: Include in fan communications
- **Video descriptions**: YouTube, TikTok, etc.

## How Routing Works

When a fan clicks your link:

1. **During your tour**: They're directed to a climate organization based on their country
2. **Outside tour dates**: They see a general AMPLIFY information page

This means:
- Links on old posters still work
- Fans always land somewhere meaningful
- No broken links, ever

### Country-Specific Routing

If you're touring in the US, fans there might be directed to Sunrise Movement. Fans in the UK might go to Extinction Rebellion. Each country has vetted partner organizations.

You can request specific organizations for your tour—just contact MDE.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens when my tour ends?

Your link still works. Fans see a general AMPLIFY page explaining the program and how to find climate organizations in their area.

### Can I change which organization fans are directed to?

Yes. Contact MDE to request changes. You can have different organizations for different countries, or override MDE's default recommendations.

### What if there's no organization for a country?

Fans in countries without a partner org see the general AMPLIFY page. MDE is always adding new partners.

### Can I see how many people used my link?

Analytics are available through MDE. Contact them for a routing summary.

### What if an organization asks to pause?

MDE monitors this. If an org needs to pause (capacity issues, etc.), fans are automatically redirected elsewhere. You don't need to do anything.

### Is fan data collected?

No personal data is stored. The system only uses the fan's country (detected from IP) to route them. No tracking, no cookies, no personal information.
