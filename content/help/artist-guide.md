## What is AMPLIFY?

AMPLIFY is a program by Music Declares Emergency that helps artists direct fans toward climate action. Your AMPLIFY link connects fans to vetted, grassroots climate organizations based on where they are.

**One link. Any country. Always works.**

---

## Your Dashboard

Your dashboard is your central hub for managing your AMPLIFY link. Here you can:

- View and copy your unique AMPLIFY link
- Generate QR codes for print materials
- Create and manage tours
- See how your link is performing

---

## Your AMPLIFY Link

Your unique link looks like this:

```
amplify.musicdeclares.net/a/your-handle
```

This single URL:
- Works anywhere in the world
- Automatically detects the fan's country
- Directs them to a relevant local climate org
- Never breaks, even between tours

### Where to Use It

- **Social bios**: Instagram, TikTok, Linktree, etc.
- **Stage visuals**: Display the QR code during shows
- **Merch & posters**: Print the QR code—it's permanent
- **Newsletters**: Include in fan communications
- **Video descriptions**: YouTube, TikTok, etc.

---

## Your Starter Kit

Visit your starter kit page to get:

- **Your AMPLIFY link** (with copy button)
- **Downloadable QR code** (print-ready, high resolution)
- **Sample social captions** (ready to copy and customize)

Find your starter kit at: **Dashboard → View Starter Kit**

Share this page with your team so everyone has access to the assets.

## Managing Tours

Tours define when your AMPLIFY link actively routes fans to climate organizations. Outside of tour dates, fans see a general AMPLIFY information page.

### Creating a Tour

1. Go to **Tours** in the navigation
2. Click **Add Tour**
3. Enter:
   - Tour name (e.g., "European Tour 2026")
   - Start and end dates
   - Optional pre-tour and post-tour windows
4. Click **Add Tour**

### Tour Windows

- **Pre-tour window**: Activate routing days before the tour starts
- **Post-tour window**: Keep routing active days after the tour ends

This helps catch early arrivals and lingering traffic.

### Configuring Country Routing

For each tour, you can specify which countries you're visiting:

1. Edit your tour
2. Click **Add Country** under "Fan Routing by Country"
3. Select each country where you'll perform

By default, fans are routed to MDE's recommended organization for each country. You can optionally select a different organization if you prefer.

---

## Understanding Fallback Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** page shows you when fans couldn't be routed to an organization. This helps you understand and fix routing issues.

### Issues You Can Fix

- **No active tour**: Add a tour covering the relevant dates
- **Country not configured**: Add the country to your tour

### Issues Requiring MDE Assistance

Some issues require help from Music Declares Emergency:
- Organization temporarily paused
- No organization available for a country
- Organization website missing

For these, use the copy button next to the event to capture details, then share with your MDE contact.

---

## Pausing Your Link

If you need to temporarily pause your AMPLIFY link:

1. Go to **Settings** in the navigation
2. Under **Link Status**, toggle the switch to pause your link
3. Optionally add a reason (only visible to MDE)

When paused, fans see a fallback page instead of being routed to organizations.

You can resume your link at any time by toggling the switch back on.

---

## Account Settings

Visit the **Settings** page to:

- View your email address
- Reset your password
- Update your display name
- Pause or resume your link

Your handle (the part of your AMPLIFY URL) cannot be changed after account creation.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens when my tour ends?

Your link still works. Fans see a general AMPLIFY page explaining the program and how to find climate organizations in their area.

### Can I have multiple tours?

Yes! You can create multiple tours, but only one can be active at a time (dates cannot overlap).

### What if there's no organization for a country?

Fans in countries without a partner org see the general AMPLIFY page. MDE is always adding new partners.

### Can I see how many people used my link?

Yes! Your dashboard shows routing statistics including total routes, successful routes to organizations, and fallback rates.

### What if an organization asks to pause?

MDE monitors this. If an org needs to pause (capacity issues, etc.), fans are automatically redirected elsewhere. You don't need to do anything.

### Is fan data collected?

No personal data is stored. The system only uses the fan's country (detected from IP) to route them. No tracking, no cookies, no personal information.
