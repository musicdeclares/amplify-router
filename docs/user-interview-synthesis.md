### Core Question Answered

**What level of effort, risk, and coordination can AMPLIFY realistically assume from artists and their teams?**

## The Spectrum (What We’re Designing Between)

### Ceiling Case (Alex)

* Activism is identity-level  
* Manager designs and runs systems  
* Fans expect political engagement  
* High effort, high conviction, low fear

➡️ **Does not scale**

### Baseline Reality (Lara)

* Artists care but are risk-averse  
* Fear of lost shows is rational  
* Logistics \+ ambiguity kill follow-through  
* Survival economics \> values under pressure

➡️ **This *must* be the design baseline**

## Shared Truths (Strong Signal)

Across *both* interviews:

* Intent is abundant; **execution** is fragile  
* Tour fatigue kills consistency  
* Education is expensive  
* **Choice** increases cognitive load  
* **Trust \+ legitimacy** matter more than variety  
* Anything that requires courage will not scale

Product must assume *minimal bravery*.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints for AMPLIFY

If AMPLIFY violates any of these, it will fail quietly:

1. **Low Effort**  
   * No custom setup per city  
   * No explanation required  
   * No ongoing management  
2. **Low Risk**  
   * Optional by show  
   * Easy to stop  
   * No political labeling implied  
3. **Low Coordination**  
   * No rider changes  
   * No venue negotiation  
   * No manager dependency

## What Actually Scales (Validated)

**Artists will reliably do:**

* Share a **single QR code**  
* Play a **short pre-show video (≤5 min)**  
* Allow **passive fan action**  
* Add light endorsement *if safe*

**Artists will not reliably do:**

* Speak onstage every night  
* Educate audiences  
* Customize per city  
* Commit tour-wide  
* Take reputational or booking risks

## Climate-Specific Reality

* Climate is not harder ideologically—but:  
  * More abstract  
  * Easier to frame as “political”  
* Therefore:  
  * **Framing \+ legitimacy \> messaging**  
  * **Default org \> multiple choices**  
  * **Reversibility is critical**

## Product Direction (Converged)

**AMPLIFY must:**

* Default to **Light → Medium engagement**  
* Treat **Heavy engagement as opt-in / advanced**  
* Target **organized artists first (≈500+ tickets)**  
* Ship **ready-to-use assets**  
* Function even if the artist never speaks

**AMPLIFY must NOT:**

* Require values articulation  
* Ask for pledges or signatures  
* Offer multi-cause menus  
* Assume activist identity

## The Real Success Metric

**Participation without courage, context, or coordination.**

If artists can participate **while tired, stressed, and cautious**, AMPLIFY works.
