# AMPLIFY Partner Organization Guidelines

*(Non-legal, operational guidance)*

These guidelines explain how partner organizations can successfully participate in **AMPLIFY**, Music Declares Emergency’s artist-facing program for connecting fans with climate action.

They are intended to support clarity, consistency, and artist safety. These guidelines do not replace or override the MOU.

## 1\. What AMPLIFY Is (and Isn’t)

**AMPLIFY is:**

* An artist-facing program that helps artists point fans to **trusted climate action pathways**  
* A lightweight bridge between artists, fans, and partner orgs  
* Designed to minimize risk and effort for artists and managers

**AMPLIFY is not:**

* A fundraising platform  
* A campaign endorsement engine  
* A guarantee of artist promotion or volunteer conversion

### 2\. The Artist Context (Why This Matters)

Most artists participating in AMPLIFY:

* Are not climate experts  
* Are risk-averse due to management, promoters, and press  
* Want to help without being put in difficult or controversial positions

Everything surfaced through AMPLIFY should be appropriate for:

* Onstage mentions  
* QR codes at venues  
* Public-facing fan engagement

## 3\. Action Quality Guidelines

To work well within AMPLIFY, partner orgs should provide:

* At least **one clear, entry-level action** that:  
  * Is understandable without prior context  
  * Does not require immediate deep commitment  
  * Is welcoming to first-time participants  
* A landing page that:  
  * Clearly explains what happens after sign-up  
  * Sets realistic expectations  
  * Avoids urgency-based pressure tactics

**Why:** AMPLIFY prioritizes first steps, not instant radicalization.

## 4\. Messaging & Tone Expectations

Content surfaced via AMPLIFY should:

* Be welcoming, inclusive, and non-judgmental  
* Avoid shaming language or moral pressure  
* Avoid endorsing or promoting violence, harassment, or illegal activity  
* Be suitable for a broad, public audience

This does not limit an org’s broader advocacy — it applies only to materials connected to AMPLIFY.

## 5\. Operational Responsiveness

To ensure a good experience for artists and fans, partner orgs are expected to:

* Keep links and contact information up to date  
* Notify MDE of:  
  * Broken links  
  * Paused or unavailable volunteer opportunities  
  * Major changes to participation pathways  
* Respond to AMPLIFY-related inquiries in a timely manner

If an org becomes temporarily unavailable, AMPLIFY may pause or redirect traffic until resolved.

## 6\. How AMPLIFY Uses Links, QR Codes, and Pages

AMPLIFY may:

* Generate QR codes or landing pages that point to partner org actions  
* Update or redirect links to maintain accuracy and usability  
* Standardize presentation for artist and fan clarity

These measures are intended to reduce friction for artists and ensure fans land in the right place.

## 7\. Measurement & Feedback (Lightweight)

AMPLIFY may track:

* QR scans  
* Page visits  
* Link clicks

Partner orgs may optionally share downstream engagement insights, but **no reporting is required** at launch.

## 8\. When Things Don’t Work

If something isn’t working well — broken links, confusing actions, mismatched tone — AMPLIFY may:

* Request updates  
* Temporarily pause visibility  
* Suggest alternative framing or actions

The goal is always to protect artists and improve fan experience, not to penalize partner orgs.

## 9\. What Success Looks Like

From an AMPLIFY perspective, success means:

* Artists feel safe and supported participating  
* Fans encounter clear, credible first steps  
* Partner orgs receive engaged, informed interest

Depth of engagement grows over time.

## Final Note

AMPLIFY works best when:

* Expectations are clear  
* Friction is low  
* Trust is maintained on all sides

These guidelines exist to support that shared goal.
